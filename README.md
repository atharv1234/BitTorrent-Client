# BitTorrent-Client

â€¢ In this project, we have developed our own bit-torrent client to contact to the trackers after parsing the torrent
file.Thereafter, fetched the list of peers from trackers and connected with them to request the piece of the file we
need to download. Finally, the pieces are saved into the final file.
